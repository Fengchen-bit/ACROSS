# ACROSS
A program collection for ACROSS data analysis and visualization

This project provides a toolkit to help researchers with **ACROSS data analysis and visualization**. Due to the large size of the datasets, we have stored the data separately. This repository primarily contains the programs and scripts we use for data processing and visualization.

Considering the manual time correction required for raw data processing and transfer function generation, we start with the processed transfer functions as our baseline. This data can be downloaded from [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/preview/p7nw36tbbf?a=67361f27-f595-4482-a322-f00a0f994cab), which includes one month of data. Given the substantial volume of data, additional data can be obtained by contacting the <corresponding author>underlined</corresponding author>.
